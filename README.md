## Template Attribution

This project incorporates and extends code from my previous class assignment:
<Siran Chen> (2024). "Project Template Repository." GitHub.
Available at: (https://github.com/sirann17/art101) and (https://github.com/arivulet/art101groupa)
W3Schools Web Development Tutorials: https://www.w3schools.com/

The original template included basic HTML structure, CSS layout, and a simple
JavaScript event-handling pattern. All gameplay logic, UI, assets, and features
in this project were taught in my previous course and are significantly expanded or rewritten by me.
